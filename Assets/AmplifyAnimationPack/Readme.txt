Using the included Animations

  1) Make sure your character is set to Humanoid. (Alternatively, use the rig in our
     Blender Source Files)
  2) Make any adjustments required as per-Unity documentation: 
      https://learn.unity.com/project/re-targeting-and-re-using-animation
      https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationsImport.html
      https://blog.unity.com/technology/mecanim-humanoids
  3) Add our Animation Sequence to your Animator Controller.

Using the Third-Person Controller
  
  1) Change the FixedTimeStep value on the Time section of the Project Settings to 0.0166667. 
     At this point you can either open the pre-configured Demo Scene located under 
     "AmplifyAnimationPack\Scenes" or proceed to Step 2. 
  2) Import the Character prefab into your desired scene.
  3) Import the CharacterUIManager prefab into your scene.
  4) Import the CharacterCameraManager prefab into your scene.
  5) In the Character prefab you've imported, set the "FollowCam", "LockCam" and "UIManger"
     variables to the FollowCamManager, LockCamManager (both childs of the CharacterCameraManager) 
     and CharacterUIManager prefabs respectively.
  6) In the CharacterCameraManager prefab you've imported, on the FollowCamManager set the "Follow" 
     and "LookAt" variables to the "Root" and "HeadMarker" childs of the Character prefab you've imported.
  7) In the CharacterCameraManager prefab you've imported, on the LockCamManager set the "Follow" to
     the "Root" child of the Character prefab you've imported.
 
 Accessing Blender Source files

  1) Unpack the BlenderSource files in the BlenderSource Unity Package located under
     "AmplifyAnimationPack\BlenderSource".
  2) Move files to an external folder. (Optional, avoids a Unity re-import when making changes 
     to the Blender file)
  3) Open file in Blender, edit as required and export. Check the Official Wiki below for details.
